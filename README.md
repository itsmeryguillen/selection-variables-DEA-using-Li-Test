# Selection of Variables in Data Envelopment Analysis using the adapted Li Test
 
This repository includes an algorithm to select variables in the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) context using the adapted Li test (Simar and Zelenyuk, 2006). When the elimination of a variable leads to statistically significant score differences, it is considered relevant to the production process. Conversely, variables that can be omitted without substantially impacting efficiency scores are considered irrelevant to the production process and are removed.

The Li test code included and its auxilary methods are an adaptation in Python of the Adapted to DEA Li test from "Computer Programs and Data to Accompany Econometric Analysis of Productivity:  Theory and Implementation in R" by Sickles, Song and Zelenyuk (https://sites.google.com/site/productivityinr).
