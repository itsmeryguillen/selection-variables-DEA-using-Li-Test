# Selection of Variables in Data Envelopment Analysis using the adapted Li Test
 
When employing Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to assess the technical efficiency of Decision-Making Units (DMUs), the selection of an optimal set of variables for the model is critical. Opting for an excessive number of variables could lead to an overestimation of efficiency among numerous units, while using too few variables may hinder the accuracy of technical efficiency estimates. Thus, careful consideration in variable selection is essential for robust DEA assessments. This repository includes an algorithm to select variables in the DEA context using the adapted Li test (https://doi.org/10.1080/07474930600972582). When the elimination of a variable leads to statistically significant score differences, it is considered relevant to the production process. Conversely, variables that can be omitted without substantially impacting efficiency scores are considered irrelevant to the production process and are removed. 

The Li test code included and its auxilary methods are an adaptation in Python of the Adapted to DEA Li test from "Computer Programs and Data to Accompany Econometric Analysis of Productivity:  Theory and Implementation in R" by Sickles, Song and Zelenyuk (https://sites.google.com/site/productivityinr).
